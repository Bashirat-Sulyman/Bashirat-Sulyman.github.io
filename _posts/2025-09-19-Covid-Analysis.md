# COVID-19 Case Rates Analysis (England)

I recently completed a Jupyter Notebook project where I explored **COVID-19 case rates by specimen date** in England.  

This project was a great opportunity to practice data analysis skills using **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**, and **Plotly** for interactive visualizations.

---

## What I Analyzed

I used publicly available data on **case rates per 100,000 people** (7-day rolling average).  
The goal was to identify patterns in how case rates changed over time.

Some of the steps I took:

- **Loaded the dataset** with Pandas
- **Cleaned the data** and focused on columns relevant to case rates and dates
- **Sorted by date** to prepare for time series analysis
- **Visualized trends** using interactive line charts

---

## Key Findings

- Case rates fluctuated significantly across different months, reflecting waves of COVID-19 activity.  
- There were visible peaks that may correspond to **surges during outbreaks**.  
- The interactive chart makes it easy to hover and see exact case rates for each day.

---
## Tools Used

- **Python** (Pandas, Plotly)
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **GitHub Pages** (for publishing the report)

## Data Source

Data from **UK Health Security Agency**:  
[Coronavirus Cases By Specimen Date (England)](https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/)


---

## What I Learned

- How to work with **real-world public health data**
- How to use **Plotly** to create interactive charts that can be shared online
- How to publish a Jupyter Notebook analysis to GitHub Pages for others to view
