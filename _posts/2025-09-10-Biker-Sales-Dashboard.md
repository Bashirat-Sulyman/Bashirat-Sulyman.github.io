For my very first project, I built a **Biker Sales Dashboard** in Excel.  
This project helped me practice **data cleaning, pivot tables, slicers, and dashboard design**.

---

## Project Overview
The dataset contained customer and sales information from a bike shop.  
My goal was to create an **interactive dashboard** that highlights purchasing patterns and customer demographics.

---

## What I Did
- Cleaned the dataset (removed duplicates, checked missing values)  
- Used **Pivot Tables** to summarize sales across categories  
- Applied **Slicers** for easy filtering by customer attributes  
- Designed charts to make the insights visually clear

---

## Dashboard Features
From the dashboard, users can explore:
1. **Filters (Slicers)** on the left:
   - **Marital Status**: Married / Single  
   - **Region**: Europe, North America, Pacific  
   - **Education**: Bachelors, Graduate Degree, High School, Partial College, Partial High School  

2. **Avg Income Per Purchase (Bar Chart)**  
   - Compares average income of buyers by **Gender (Male vs Female)**  
   - Split by whether a bike was purchased (Yes/No).  

3. **Customer Age Bracket (Line Chart)**  
   - Groups customers into **Adolescent, Middle Age, and Old**  
   - Shows how many bikes were purchased across age groups.  

4. **Customer Commute (Line Chart)**  
   - Shows purchases across commute distances:  
     - 0â€“1 Miles  
     - 1â€“2 Miles  
     - 2â€“5 Miles  
     - 5â€“10 Miles  
     - More than 10 Miles
